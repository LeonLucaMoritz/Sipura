An easy-to-use, safe and transparent library for graph datastructures and algorithms.

### Installation

To install the library in your project, download the
JAR from *releases* on the right and add it to the classpath of your
project.
If you use IntelliJ, you can easily do this under File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> + -> Java
This approach is documented by
JetBrains [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/library.html#define-a-project-library)
